## Overview

This timeline provides a week-by-week breakdown of Docs team responsibilities throughout the Kubernetes release cycle. Each phase includes specific tasks, deadlines, and checklists.

For each release, the schedule with deliverables is added to the release directory. This section talks about specific Docs Lead deliverables for each milestone in the release timeline.

Read the release timeline and **make sure the timeline includes deadlines for documentation work**, e.g: [1.35 timeline](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.35#timeline):

- Docs deadline - Reminder for *Open placeholder PRs* in the respective KEPs (~3.5 weeks before release)
- Docs deadline - Reminder for *PRs ready for review* in the respective KEPs (~2 weeks before release)
- Docs complete - All PRs reviewed and ready to merge (~1 week before release)

If these deadlines aren't listed in the release timeline, request that the Release Lead add them.
Define deadlines clearly e.g. End of Day (EOD) PST is not clear if EOD is 5:00 PM or 11:59 AM PST.

Responsibilities of the Docs Team:
- Same as [Docs Lead responsibilities](../docs#docs-lead-responsibilities)
- Track Doc PRs for KEPs in the [website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) project, plus all Doc PRs for the dev-[future release] branch that may include general updates without a KEP.
- By default, all opted-in KEPs will `Need Docs`. Enhancement owners/contributors should confirm the enhancement does not need new or updated documentation.

> Note: The blog-PR  is tracked by the Release Comms Team.

> Note: The kubernetes/website repo changed from using a `master` branch to a `main` branch in 2021.
> Be aware that several linked, example PRs uses the `master` branch.
> For the end-of-year release, KubeCon NA and the US Thanksgiving holiday can be additional impediments to Docs-related deadlines. Please communicate to enhancement owners/contributors about upcoming deadlines earlier and more frequently.

## Phase 1: Early Steps (Weeks 1-2)

**Time Required:** ~1-2 hours total for initial setup

### 1.1 Connect with Release Team

#### Getting Started

- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the [release team and process](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team)

#### Slack & Messaging

- [ ] Join `#sig-release` and introduce yourself as Docs Lead for [future release]
- [ ] Send DM to Release Lead introducing yourself
- [ ] Join `#sig-docs` channel
- [ ] Join `#release-docs` channel
- [ ] Join `#release-management` channel
- [ ] Join `#release-notes` channel
- [ ] Join `#chairs-and-techleads` channel (Note: This channel is particularly helpful as the Doc Team approaches Doc Freeze, as members here can help with `lgtm` on Doc PRs)

#### Google Groups

| Google Group | PR Required? | Where to Add |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| [kubernetes-sig-release](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-release) | No | Direct join |
| [kubernetes-sig-docs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-docs) | No | Direct join |
| [kubernetes-dev](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev) | No | Direct join |
| [kubernetes-release-team](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/release-team) | **Yes** | List of members for this group is managed in git. Please create a PR against `kuberenetes/sig-release` repo to include your email under `release-team` group in [`sig-release/groups.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/groups/sig-release/groups.yaml)<br>Example PRs: [k8s.io/pull/7713](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/7713), [k8s.io/pull/8585](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/8585) |
| [kubernetes-release-team-shadows](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/release-team-shadows) | **Yes** | List of members for this group is managed in git. Please create a PR against `kuberenetes/sig-release` repo to include your email under `release-team-shadows` group in [`sig-release/groups.yaml`](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/groups/sig-release/groups.yaml)<br>Example PRs: [k8s.io/pull/7713](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/7713), [k8s.io/pull/8585](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/8585) |

#### Enhancement Tracking Setup

Early in the release cycle, the Enhancements Lead opens a GitHub Project, e.g., [the 1.26 Enhancement Tracking](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/98/views/1). Later in the release, this project board will contain important information for the Docs team. Check the Docs view [here](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/98/views/6):

- Which enhancements the team will be tracking for this release
- Feature owners (and their GitHub IDs)
- Links to docs PRs opened for each enhancement
- Docs requirement status (default: "Needs Docs")
- PR documentation status (No PR, Draft PR, Ready-for-Review PR, Merged PR)

- [ ] Get edit access to Enhancement Tracking spreadsheet from Enhancements Lead
  - Example: [1.26 Enhancement Tracking](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/projects/98/views/1)
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the Docs view of the tracker

> [!Important]
> Until [1.25](https://tinyurl.com/k8s125-enhancements), a tracking spreadsheet was used. e.g.: [the 1.21 release spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/k8s121-enhancements).

### 1.2 Update Release Team & Access Control

#### Access & Permission Setup

- [ ] Make sure your team is included in the "current" release team file, e.g: [release 1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.21/release-team.md). **If not submit a PR see a sample for 1.21 [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/1432)**.
- [ ] Make sure you are included in the `k/sig-release` release team group [sig-release/group.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/groups/sig-release/groups.yaml)
  - Example: [v1.35 PR to update release team groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/8498)
- [ ] Please create a PR against `k/sig-release` repo to include the email ids of the Docs Team member of this release under release-team group in [sig-release/group.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/blob/main/groups/sig-release/groups.yaml).
  - Example: [v1.35 Docs Shadows PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/8585)
- [ ] Open a PR to add the Docs Team in the `release-[future release]`. Here is an example of the [v1.35 Release Team](https://github.com/Urvashi0109/sig-release/blob/558161ffcdd2791543a233bd19f88b9e62b06cd8/releases/release-1.35/release-team.md).
  - Example PR: [v1.35 Docs Shadows PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/pull/2875)
- [ ] Open a PR to add yourself (Docs Lead Only) to `k/k` [CHANGELOG OWNERS](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/OWNERS) `approvers` and `reviewers` section.
- [ ] Make sure you are part of the [sig-docs-en-owners](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-en-owners).
  - Reference PRs: [kubernetes/website/pull/44709](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44709), [kubernetes/website/pull/52585](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/52585)
- [ ] Open a PR for approval permission in the [OWNERS_ALIASES](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/OWNERS_ALIASES)
  - Example PR: [v1.21 release](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/26114).
- [ ] Add docs team to the `website-milestone-maintainers` group in k/org/config/kubernetes/sig-docs/teams.yaml and `release-team` group in k/org/kubernetes/sig-release/teams.yaml.
  - Example PR: [v1.21 release](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/2445).
- [ ] ⚠️ **Integration Branch Setup (Docs Lead responsibility)**: You need push access to the Kubernetes website repo (contact a SIG Docs chair if you don't have it). Open the [integration branch] by creating a pull request titled `Official [future release] Release Docs` against `main` referencing the `dev-[future release]` branch.
  - Reference PRs: [kubernetes/website/pull/52613](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/52613), [kubernetes/website/pull/50589](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/50589)
  
  This release pull request (also known as the [integration branch]) serves as the base for individual, component enhancement PRs of the release. An [integration branch] lets you bundle and merge multiple PRs simultaneously.

  ⚠️ Add the label `do-not-merge/hold` to the PR.
- [ ] First PR in `dev-[future release]`: Update hugo.toml to show `[future release]` as the current version and add the `[future release]` entry to the drop-down. The intent is that your new branch should be showing as the current version IN the new branch.
  - Example PR: [v1.27 Updated hugo.toml](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/40231)

### 1.3 Introduce Yourself to Localization Teams

- [ ] Create GitHub discussion in [k/sig-release](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/discussions/) to introduce yourself to the current localization owners and to sync up early on the release timeline.

**Template:**
```markdown
Title: K8s [future release] - Formalize docs release strategy with docs localization owners

Hello 👋,

I'm [Your Name], the SIG Release Docs lead for the [future release] release.

I'm opening this discussion to coordinate the docs release (tentatively scheduled for [Release Date]) with localization owners.

Key dates:
- Docs Freeze: [Date]
- Release Day: [Date]

I look forward to working with everyone! Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you! 🙏

@kubernetes/sig-docs-uk-owners @kubernetes/sig-docs-it-owners
```

### 1.4 Attend Meetings and Provide Updates

#### Meeting Requirements

⚠️ **Mandatory Attendance**: Either the Docs Lead or a Shadow must attend these meetings:
- **Release Team meetings** (weekly)
- **SIG Docs meetings** (bi-weekly)

If you cannot attend, ensure a Shadow attends in your place or updates the meeting notes with relevant information (staffing updates, branch syncs, placeholder PR deadlines, etc.).

#### Status Reporting Guide

Report status as **Green🟢**, **Yellow**🟡, or **Red🔴** based on the criteria below. SIG Docs encourages marking status as Yellow or Red when issues need attention—don't wait until problems become critical.

##### Status Criteria Reference

| Category | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **Branch Health & Syncs** | - Integration Branch healthy (no rebase needed) → `Green`<br>- Integration Branch needs rebase or has conflicts → `Yellow/Red`<br><br>- Weekly branch syncs completed on time → `Green`<br>- 1-2 syncs missed → `Yellow`<br>- 3+ syncs missed → `Red`<br>- Sync PR needs review or has merge conflicts → `Yellow` (mention in #release-docs if help needed)<br><br>- Release Notes PR open, reviewed, and merged on time → `Green`<br>- Release Notes PR late or blocked → `Red` |
| **Placeholder PR Deadlines** | **1 week before:**<br>- 80%+ enhancements have placeholder PRs → `Green`<br>- 60-79% have placeholder PRs → `Yellow`<br>- <60% have placeholder PRs → `Red`<br><br>**3 days before:**<br>- 90%+ enhancements have placeholder PRs → `Green`<br>- <90% have placeholder PRs → `Yellow/Red` |
| **Ready for Review Deadlines** | **1 week before:**<br>- 80%+ docs PRs ready for review → `Green`<br>- 60-79% ready for review → `Yellow`<br>- <60% ready for review → `Red`<br><br>**3 days before:**<br>- 90%+ docs PRs ready for review → `Green`<br>- <90% ready for review → `Yellow/Red` |
| **Docs Complete (Merged) Deadlines** | **1 week before:**<br>- 80%+ docs PRs merged → `Green`<br>- 60-79% merged → `Yellow`<br>- <60% merged → `Red`<br><br>**3 days before:**<br>- 90%+ docs PRs merged → `Green`<br>- <90% merged → `Yellow/Red` (mention if SIG Docs approver/reviewer help needed) |
| **Critical Deadline Days** | - Day before any deadline: Outstanding items/PRs exist → `Yellow/Red` (list specific blockers)<br>- Day of any deadline: Outstanding items/PRs exist → `Red` (⚠️ requires immediate attention) |

#### Reporting Tips
- Be specific about blockers (e.g., "5 PRs need technical review from SIG Network")
- Highlight assistance needed from other SIGs
- Mark Yellow/Red proactively—it helps the community prioritize support

### 1.5 Shadow Selection & Onboarding

#### Select Shadows

You will be provided with survey results from people interested working on the release team. If you do not have the results, contact the Release Lead for more information.

After vetting the volunteers for their roles, role leads should make a final decision on selected shadows with the incoming Release Team Lead & Release Team Subproject Lead / Emeritus Advisor. In the past, the SIG Docs release team has been between 3-6 members. Read the following document to know more about the role of [Shadow in the Release Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/release-team-selection.md#shadows).

> [!Important]
> Beyond meeting the basic requirements and time commitments, a good Shadow is someone who is active in SIG-Docs. Selection priority should go to previous shadows who want to eventually lead a SIG-Docs release. Other than those few guidelines, use your best judgement!

#### Contact Selected Shadows

- [ ] Create a Slack Group with the selected shadows and send them a message.
**Template:**
```markdown
Welcome to the Kubernetes v1.35 Docs team! :k8s-heart: Beyond just shipping docs, this is a space for collaboration, growth, and fun. Looking forward to learning from each other and making this journey memorable.:kubernetes-intensifies:

👋 Hi everyone! [Introduce yourself with your name, workplace, k8s community involvement, timezone etc]

I’d love to hear from you all - please introduce yourself so we can all get to know each other. ☺️

We are an inclusive group so if there’s something you’re concerned about, or don’t understand, don’t worry and just ask! Also, do let me know if there's any issues with being a shadow (with respect to timing / availability / etc).
```

- [ ] Send a Slack message with the first step of onboarding tasks as a shadow.
**Template:**
```markdown
We’ll be collaborating on the v1.35 Docs over the next few months.

Our team includes both returning & new members, so feel free to ask questions and support one another whenever possible. During this cycle, we’ll be working on tasks such as:
- Creating and reviewing release notes PRs.
- Syncing the main branch with the development branch.
- Reaching out to KEPs to raise placeholder Doc PRs.
- Providing status updates during weekly release team meetings and bi-weekly SIG-Docs meetings.

I’ll walk you through these tasks during our onboarding call.🤜🤛

**Action items (React to this post with a :white_check_mark: once you’ve completed the items)**:
- Onboarding: Make sure to complete the [onboarding guide](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/release-team/release-team-onboarding.md#new-members)
  - Some onboarding specifics for new members:
    - Review the [Community Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md).
    - Sign the [CLA](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md).
    - Apply to become an **org member** (`kubernetes` and `kubernetes-sigs`) by [creating an issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fgithub-membership&template=membership.yml&title=REQUEST%3A+New+membership+for+%3Cyour-GH-handle%3E) ( use @[Release Team Subproject Lead / Emeritus Advisor] @[Release Lead] as your sponsors)
        - Example PR: https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/5626
  - Join the appropriate slack channels #release-notes #sig-release #release-management #release-docs #release-comms
  - Subscribe to the [Release Google Calendar](https://bit.ly/k8s-release-cal) and join the [release-team](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/release-team) and [sig-release](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-release) Google Groups.
  - When it comes to contributing and reviewing PRs, you should check out the docs style guide: https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/
  - Docs Handbook: Review the [Docs-Handbook](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks/docs) to get an idea of what to expect with the role.

**Resources**:
- Know your Timelines: [Release Timeline](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-[future-release]/README.md) to keep track of where we are in the cycle and what is expected at each interval, especially the Docs deadlines as they’ll be crucial for our team. I will also provide updates and reminders as we progress.

**Meetings**:
- Shadow Onboarding Meeting: I'd love to jump on a call to go over the release process with everybody, describe what we'll be doing, and answer any questions. Below is a poll to see what time works best for everyone. As we near the end of the release cycle I will add a regular weekly check-in. Please select your preferred time(s): [include the Doodle Link]
```

### 1.6 Shadow Onboarding Meeting

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes
**Record:** Yes, share with team for reference

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Schedule meeting using poll results
- [ ] Create meeting agenda
- [ ] Record session.
- [ ] Share recording and slides (if any) with team.

**Agenda:**
1. Introductions (5-10 min)
1. Release process overview (15-20 min)
1. Walk through this timeline document (15-20 min)
1. Q&A (10-15 min)
1. Set expectation that the mantra is "Hurry up & Wait" - but it does get hectic in the last few weeks.

### 1.7 Team Responsibility Tracker

> **Note:** This is an optional but recommended practice that proved valuable in recent releases.

A responsibility tracker (spreadsheet or document) helps the Docs team distribute work fairly and avoid confusion during the release cycle. Create a shared spreadsheet to track `Release`, `Weekly Branch Sync PR`, `PR merge deadline`, `Release Notes assignee` and `Release Notes reviewer`. Team members can self-assign tasks, ensuring clear ownership and proactive planning. This serves as an internal schedule for tracking progress and providing status updates during release team and SIG Docs meetings.

**Example:** [Docs Team Responsibility Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bij8ayB_yf8mPic1upcf13N5yHRF7HguIoYXLvU1Mss/edit?usp=sharing)

### Update the website configuration ahead of the release

Update the main `hugo.toml` based on the version on the `main` branch. Open a PR for these changes against the `dev-[future release]` branch (which should already exist - this is a good check!)

```shell
# Step 1
# Do this on a fresh local clone OF YOUR FORK
# It's OK to use SSH for the git URL if you know how to do that
git clone https://github.com/yourGitHubUsername/website.git kubernetes-website
cd kubernetes-website
# Step 2
# Add the upstream repo as a remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git

git fetch upstream dev-[future release]
git checkout --track upstream/dev-[future release]
git checkout -b config-toml-[future release] # change for the release you're making, for example config-toml-1.21
# Step 3
# Edit hugo.toml to make the changes described above
# save your changes
git add hugo.toml
git commit -m "Updated hugo.toml for [future release] release"
# Step 4
# Check things look right
git status
git remote -v
# Step 5
# Push this new branch to your fork
git push origin config-toml-[future release]
```

Now create a pull request that targets the next release (here: `dev-1.21`) **not** `main`.


## Middle Steps (Weeks 3-8)
The middle weeks of the launch are where the Docs Lead and Docs Lead Shadows track and review incoming PRs.

### Track PRs

Track PRs based on the enhancement (KEP) spreadsheet.

Keep the enhancement tracking spreadsheet up to date with review progress and merge status for each documentation PR. For example: [Kubernetes Enhancements OSS tracking board (1.21 release)](http://bit.ly/k8s121-enhancements)

⚠️ Assign the enhancements evenly across your Shadows after the enhancement freeze. Assigning shadows before the
 enhancement freeze will cause unexpected behavior in the tracking spreadsheet due to frequent updates to dynamic data.
 (Tip: When assigning enhancements, try grouping enhancement owners and/or by SIGs)
  - You and your Shadows will be responsible for tracking whether the enhancement:
    - **has docs:** Actively has docs in place on Kubernetes website or in flight
    - **needs docs:** Actively needs docs to support the enhancement in the [future-release]
    - **unknown:** After reviewing the KEP, it is unclear if this needs docs or not
    - **not required:** The KEP doesn't change anything that requires reflection in Kubernetes website
  - You and your Shadows will also be responsible for marking whether the docs are:
    - **Complete (Merged):** PR on the dev-[future-release] is done and merged
    - **No PR:** No PR is open (helpful for dead line tracking)
    - **Late:** No PR is open AND it's passed the deadline
    - **Draft (PR):** PR is open but content isn't ready for review
    - **Ready for Review (PR):** PR is open but content IS ready for review
- ⚠️ Make sure that every docs PRs for the release have the correct base and set the correct Milestone. For example, enhancement PRs for version 1.21 need abase branch of `dev-1.21` and the Milestone set to `1.21`.

The spreadsheet can be used to track the current health of the docs for release. For example:

![Sample spreadsheet](pics/enhancement-tracking.png)

On the "Enhancement Stats" tab, a table was created to track the Doc Stats and then based on their category, in the other tab, assign a status "Green / Yellow / Red."

This is very helpful for weekly reports and managing deadlines

### Communicate major deadlines

The Release Lead and Enhancements Lead will send announcements to the [Kubernetes Dev Group](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev) periodically during the release cycle.
Communicate with the Release Lead and Enhancements Lead to include the Doc Placeholder PR, Doc PR Ready-for-Review, and Docs Complete deadlines in their announccements.

### Begin generating Release Notes
Begin running release-notes tool for the ongoing collection of release notes with the first alpha release, which has been cut directly after the latest minor.

- Update the `release-notes-draft.md`
- Verify release notes are available on (relnotes.k8s.io)[https://relnotes.k8s.io/]
- Informal intro meeting with release notes team to discuss contact information and logistics

#### Set up the Tools and Generate the Release Notes

The Docs team is responsible for the generation of the release notes during the release cycle.

At least one member of the Docs Team should be responsible for [setting up](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/tree/master/docs/krel#installation) and [running](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/release-notes.md) the release-notes subcommand of krel to generate the release notes after each Patch Release:

1. Update the release notes draft, a markdown file which will become the final document which will encompass all release notes written by contributors during the current release cycle. See previous drafts for versions [1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.25/release-notes/release-notes-draft.md), [v1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.24/release-notes/release-notes-draft.md) or [v1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release-1.23/release-notes/release-notes-draft.md).

Detailed instructions for generating the release notes bundle is in the [krel release-notes subcommand documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/release/blob/master/docs/krel/release-notes.md).

#### Periodically review and fix new release notes

The Docs team must make sure that the final document includes well-written and informative release notes. To achieve a high-quality document the team should review and edit the
notes by running `krel release-notes --fix` weekly or as often as development pace
demands.

This command will enable the team to review each release note and edit the note's data. It is recommended that the team splits the work among all members and runs the editing flow on a weekly or biweekly basis. More information about the editing flow can be found in a separate document detailing the [editing process and tooling](editing-flow.md).

The general style guide for release notes includes checking for:
- Past tense: Release notes should be written in the past tense since the changes have already been implemented.
- Technical jargon: While the notes are generally user-friendly, some technical terms like "VAC" or "scheduling hints" could be explained briefly with backticks or double quotes for users unfamiliar with them.
- Additional context: In some cases, providing more context about the problem these changes address or the specific situations where they're relevant could be helpful for understanding their significance. You can find additional context referenced in the PR in k8s/k8s repo to check what the PR does for end users.

Additional style guidelines can be found in the [Documentation Style Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/).

#### Maintain Known Issues

A ["Known Issues Umbrella Issue"](known-issues-bucket.md) for the release must be created by the Docs team in [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/new) so issues can be collected for the "Known Issues" section of the release notes. See previous known issues for [1.25](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/110336), [1.24](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/109027), [v1.23](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/104885), [v1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/101728), [v1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/98232), [v1.19](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90304), [v1.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/86882) or [v1.17](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/83683).

#### Ensure Release Highlights are Reflected in the Notes

The Communications team will hold a meeting to discuss Release Highlights sometime around Code Freeze. Ensure that at least one person from the Docs team attends this meeting with the Release Lead and Enhancements Lead. The Docs team should ensure that the "Release Highlights" identified in this meeting are reflected in the "Release Highlights" section of the release notes. If no one is able to attend the meeting, reach out to the Communications team, Release Lead or Enhancements Lead to ensure messaging around Release Highlights is coordinated.

#### Get feedback from SIG Leads

Around Code Freeze, the Docs team will get in touch with the SIG Leads to ensure that the Release Notes accurately reflect the major themes for their SIGs. The team will also ensure that major issues captured in the release notes are confirmed by the SIG leads before release day.

If gentle nudging of SIG Leads is not effective in retrieving feedback/confirmation, the Docs Team can use a reasonable amount of creative liberty in completing the notes.

### Reach out to Enhancement Owners

#### Before the Open Placeholder PR Deadline
After the Enhancement Freeze, reach out to all tracked enhancements to see if new docs or modification to existing docs
are required, e.g:

> Hello < tag enhancement owner(s) > :wave:, < future-release > Docs < Shadow/Lead > here.
>
> Does this enhancement work planned for < future-release > require any new docs or modification to existing docs?
>
> If so, please follows the steps [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/#open-a-placeholder-pr)
> to open a PR against `dev-[future release]` branch in the `k/website` repo. This PR can be just a placeholder at this
> time and must be created before < Docs Open Paceholder deadline HH:MM timezone>
>
> Also, take a look at [Documenting for a release](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/#for-developers-or-other-sig-members)
> to get yourself familiarize with the docs requirement for the release.
>
> Thank you!

#### Before the PRs Ready for Review Deadline
After the Open Placeholder PR deadline, reach out to all open/tracked doc PRs to remind the PR owners to get their doc ready to be reviewed, e.g:

> Hello < tag doc owner(s) > :wave: please take a look at [Documenting for a release - PR Ready for Review](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/new-content/new-features/#pr-ready-for-review)
> to get your PR ready for review before < PR Ready for Review deadline HH:MM timezone >. Thank you!

#### Before the Docs Freeze Deadline

1. **Update the Enhancements board**
  - You and your Shadows are also responsible for updating the Status of the enhancement as tracked or at risk for Docs Freeze:
    - **Tracked for Docs Freeze:** Documentation is in an active review, will likely be merged by Doc Freeze deadline or has already been merged.
    - **At Risk for Docs Freeze:** The Docs Freeze deadline is upcoming and the documentation looks to be at risk of making that deadline, risking an exception.

2. **Coordinate a Plan with SIG Docs**:
It is crucial for the Docs Lead to plan and coordinate with the SIG Docs leads, especially between the PR Ready for Review deadline and the Docs Freeze deadline. Establish a clear plan to address the available capacity of SIG Docs and Release Docs to review doc PRs and anticipate potential obstacles such as KubeCon or other events that might affect the availability of reviewers. Ask how Release Docs can help!

3. **Communicate Docs Freeze at start of Review**
After the PR ready for review deadline, reach out to all open/tracked doc PRs to remind the PR owners to get docs reviewed, e.g:

> Hello < tag doc owner(s) > :wave:, a friendly reminder that this PR needs a doc review by < Docs Complete Deadline HH:MM timezone > to get this
> into the release. Please reach out to required SIGs to get their review. Thank you!

For a technical review, reach out to the KEP reviewers and approvers. KEP reviewers and approvers are usually listed in the
[kep.yaml e.g.](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness/kep.yaml)

> Hello < tag KEP reviewer(s) / approver(s) > :wave: please provide a technical review for this PR by < Docs Complete deadline HH:MM timezone >
> to get this into the release. Thank you!

#### Week of Docs Freeze

Follow up with owners of all docs PRs that are not in a mergeable state via both a GitHub comment and a Slack DM. To be ready to merge, a PR requires both `/lgtm` and `/approve`, one of them from a technical reviewer, and comments and suggestions addressed. If the docs owner or KEP owners are unresponsive, you may reach out to the chairs and technical leads of the SIG that owns the associated KEP.

Example:


>Hello {doc/KEP owners} 👋! I'm reaching out from the Docs team.
Just checking in as we approach **Docs Freeze on {date with timezone}**.
This documentation appears to still be under review. To meet the Docs Freeze, this PR must have a technical review as well as `lgtm` and `approve` labels applied, without any unaddressed comments or concerns from SIG Docs.
The status of this enhancement is marked as `at risk for docs freeze`. Thank you!


#### After Docs Freeze

Once Docs Freeze has passed, if there are any docs PRs not marked "ready to merge," reach out in the PR with the following:

>Hello 👋, {current release} Docs team here.
This PR did not meet deadline for [docs freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/release_phases.md#docs-freeze).
Enhancements without required documentation may be removed from the current release. If you still wish to include this enhancement in {current release}, please file an [exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md) request. Thanks!

### Maintain the current and upcoming `dev` branch

This allows us to avoid merge conflicts on release day with `dev-[future release]`.

#### ⚠️ Periodically merge `main` into `dev-[future release]`

To merge `main` into `dev-[future release]` on your local fork:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:{YOUR_USER}/website.git
# Step 0 (if you don't already have a remote called "upstream")
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git | git remote add upstream git@github.com:kubernetes/website.git
# Step 1
git fetch upstream main
# Step 2
git fetch upstream dev-[future release]
# Step 3
git checkout --track upstream/dev-[future release]
# Step 4
git pull --ff-only # make sure you're up to date
# Step 5 You might see merge conflicts at this point.
git merge upstream/main
## if needed: https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/
## git add ...
## git merge --continue
# Step 6
git checkout -b merged-main-dev-[future release]
# Step 7
git commit -m "Merge main into dev-[future release] to keep in sync"
# Step 8
git push origin merged-main-dev-[future release]
```

You may need to fix conflicts manually. If somebody has improved a page on `main`, and at the same time it has been updated in the dev branch for the next release, we may need to figure out how to make those changes work together. If something comes up which isn't obvious, you can always abort the merge and reach out to SIG Docs for help.

When you have completed resolving the differences manually, run `git merge --continue` to complete the merge. Then carry on from step 5.

Submit a PR against upstream `dev-[future release]` from your fork's branch `merged-main-dev-[future release]` by changing the
`base` to `dev-[future-release]` when creating the PR.
e.g. [Merge main into future release](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/16225).

⚠️  **Ensure the PR is passing tests on GitHub**.

Perform merge activity on a regular basis to ensure a smooth release. eg: once/week during intial weeks and increase the frequency if required closer to the end of the release cycle.

Report out the `dev-[future release]` branch health in Release Team meetings and sig-docs meetings.

### Monitor PRs

Make a query showing all PRs raised against dev-[future release] and monitor that regularly e.g., [1.21 search](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+base%3Adev-1.21+label%3Alanguage%2Fen)

### Enforce deadlines

Enforce deadlines the day after. Communicate with SIGs via Slack and email lists to keep everyone up-to-date on status.

### Review PRs

It is the Docs Lead and Shadows' responsibility to ensure the incoming docs meet our standards. Considering SIG Docs has limited capacity, the Release Doc Lead and Shadows should actively engage in reviewing and providing feedback on documentation changes in each of their PRs. It's impossible for us to understand every technical component, so it is important to get a technical LGTM too if you're unsure about technical accuracy.

Also review each PR for:

- Check that the PR is in the `[future release]` milestone
- Check that the KEP / enhancement is likely to land in `[future release]`.
- Review PR commit histories, and make sure that PR commit histories contain only changes to files. It's especially important to **avoid revert commits**. Encourage developers to rebase any PRs with complicated commit histories.
- Check that the PR has a technical LGTM.
- KEP reviewers and approvers can provide a technical review or delegate appropriatley. KEP reviewers and approvers are usually listed in the [kep.yaml e.g.](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness/kep.yaml)
- If no LGTM, assign `sig/*` labels (listed in the enhancement tracking spreadsheet) to help find technical reviewers.

#### Style Guide Checklist (High to Low Level)

The [style guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/) consists of guidelines, not rules.

- Make sure new docs use the correct page content type.
    - [Concept](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/page-content-types/#concept)
    - [Task](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/page-content-types/#task)
    - [Tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/page-content-types/#tutorial)
- Make sure the page content renders correctly.
    - Numbered list
    - Code blocks
    - [Shortcodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/#shortcodes) for notes, cautions, and warnings
- Make sure the content makes sense
    - Check spelling
    - Consider the Style Guide's [best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/#content-best-practices) and [patterns to avoid](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/#patterns-to-avoid)

> Note: Most PR owners are **not** writers, and many are non-native / secondary English speakers. Missing commas or passive voice should **not** block a /lgtm if the content is accurate. If something really bugs you, make a note and open a PR to fix it later.

Once the above is met, comment the following on the PR:

```
/lgtm
/approve
```

(you might already have /lgtm from the technical review stage; another /lgtm is fine if the prerequisites are already met).

If you need help reviewing PRs, ask SIG Docs (#sig-docs channel on Slack) for help. The weekly [PR Wrangler](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/wiki/PR-Wranglers) is your best resource.

> Note: PR's against the dev branch can merged at any time assuming they meet the criteria. Be careful though that you don't merge a feature that might be pushed out to the next release. If that happens, you can revert - but it's better to avoid the mess all together.
>
> You can add /hold to mark a PR that should not merge until the matching code changes are already in.

### Nominate a Docs Lead for the Next Release

⚠️ During Code Freeze, pick a successor who has demonstrated the ability and understanding of the process.

**Usually this is a Docs Lead Shadow that has been on the team for 2 releases with a desire to continue with the SIG Docs.**

- Reach out to the person you have in mind and confirm they are able to commit the time and effort for a successful release.
- Once confirmed, inform the Release Team and the SIG Docs Team.

If no suitable candidates are available, you may choose to lead again or nominate someone outside of the current release team (e.g: a recent Docs Lead).

## Late-Middle Steps (Weeks 7-8) - Sync with Comms team on the release blog post

The Docs Lead is responsible for publishing the release blog post during the release day. Therefore, it's important to
follow the status of the blog posts created by the Comms team.

Validate that the Comms team has all the blog posts (release and features) ready for the upcoming release.
If unsure, send a message to their [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/release-comms/) channel, e.g:

> Hi Comms team :wave: 1.21 Docs Lead here, can someone confirm that all blog posts PRs related to the release have been
> opened and are being reviewed? Is there anything the Docs team can do to help?

Be congnizant of the status of the release blog post as merging and publishing the release blog post is a significant step on release day e.g., [1.21 release blog](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/27233).

## Late Steps (Weeks 9-11) - Prep for the release

### Touch base with SIG Docs

The Kubernetes API reference, kubectl, and components documentation are generated by a SIG Docs tech lead. Check in with SIG Docs with a brief reminder, and confirm that they have everything they need to generate these docs.

### Touch base with SIG Cluster Lifecycle (kubeadm)

Validate that SIG Cluster Lifecycle has all of the docs in place for the upcoming release. These are mainly kubeadm docs (upgrading, installing, changes, etc). If unsure, send a message to their [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/sig-cluster-lifecycle/) channel, e.g:

> Hi SIG Cluster Lifecylce :wave:  1.21 Docs Lead here, can someone confirm that all docs are in place for the upcoming 1.21 release?

### Clean up and edit the final Release Notes

The confirmed release notes are cleaned up and copy edited by the Docs team to ensure uniform language/style is used. The team must make sure that the final document conforms to the [Documentation Style Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/).

### Curate the External Dependencies section

A "Dependencies" section should be curated which outlines how external dependency versions have changed since the last release. These changes are currently [automatically aggregated](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/issues/2234), but should still be manually validated for correct content and formatting.

### Update Releases Page (the week before the release)

Create a PR against the dev-[future-release] branch to add an entry for [future-release] on https://kubernetes.io/releases.

To update https://kubernetes.io/releases, update https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/main/data/releases/schedule.yaml.
The following fields are required:
  - `release`: <1.xy>
  - `releaseDate`: <YYYY-MM-DD> # date of release
  - `next`: <1.xy.1>
  - `cherryPickDeadline`: <YYYY-MM-DD> # the Friday before `targetDate`
  - `targetDate`: <YYYY-MM-DD> # the 2nd Wednesday of the next month
  - `maintenanceModeStartDate`: # 2 months before `endOfLifeDate`
  - `endOfLifeDate`: <YYYY-MM-DD> # the 28th of the month after 1 year and 2 months after the release

[Example PR for 1.29](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44135)
Have a Release Manager lgtm the dates on the PR.
This PR can be merged on release day by the Docs lead.

## Release Week (Week 12)
⚠️  Everything in this section is important. It's OK to ask for advice if you're not sure.

### Update the site configuration files for previous releases

Working from your fork of the `kubernetes/website` repository, update the `config.toml` files for the 4 previous releases. You need to open 4 separate PRs, because each release has its own `release-` branch.

For the immediately previous release, there will not be a `release-[previous-release]` branch, so you should open the pull request updating the site configuration for the previous release targeting `main` and update the base branch to `release-[previous-release]` once you have created the `release-[previous-release]` branch.

See this for example (1.29 was the "future release"):
* 1.25 https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44302
* 1.26 https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44301
* 1.27 https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44299
* 1.28 https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44298

Changes required:
- Set `latest` to the [future release] version
- Update `githubbranch` and `fullversion` (if present) to the latest patched version of the corresponding release
- Update the list of versions to include the [future release] and remove the oldest release
- Set `deprecated` to `true`
- For each previous release, update the patch version to the latest patch version available

Here is an example of the steps taken to update the release 1.28 config.toml for the future release 1.29, as well as the [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44298)

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git && git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
git fetch upstream main
git pull --ff-only
# make necessary updates to hugo.toml at this point
git checkout -b update-release-1.28-hugo.toml
git add .
git commit -m "Updates v1.28 hugo.toml for release v1.29"
git push origin update-release-1.28-hugo.toml
Go to your fork in a browser: https://www.github.com/{YOUR_USER}/website
Submit a PR against upstream `main` from your fork's branch `update-release-[previous-release]-hugo.toml`. The day before the release, once you have created the `release-[previous-release]` branch, change the base branch for this PR from `main` to `release-[previous-release]`
```

Here is an example of the steps taken to update the release 1.27 config.toml for the future release v1.29, as well as the [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/44299)

```shell
git fetch upstream release-1.27
git checkout --track upstream/release-1.27
# make necessary updates to hugo.toml at this point
git checkout -b update-release-1.27-hugo.toml
git add .
git commit -m "Updates v1.27 hugo.toml for release v1.29"
git push origin update-release-1.27-hugo.toml
In this case, a PR is submitted against `release-1.27` from the fork's branch `update-release-1.27-hugo.toml`.
```

⚠️  DO NOT MERGE **ANY** OF THE CONFIGURATION PULL REQUESTS UNTIL THE RELEASE HAS OCCURRED

### Update the site configuration files for future release

The future release branch site configuration also needs to be updated to reflect the latest patch versions of the past releases.
Create a PR against the `dev-[future-release]` branch to update the `config.toml` file that matches the
[PRs for previous releases](#update-the-site-configuration-files-for-previous-releases).

### Inform localization teams

Let localization teams know about the k/website repo freeze and the tentative timeline(s) for important dates with a comment to the GitHub discussion created earlier in the release cycle.

> Hello localization team leads! I don't think any action is required from you, but I wanted to let you know that we are on track for the release on April 8, 2021 and all Kubernetes website branches are up to date (main, dev-1.21). Let me know if I can help with anything! Thanks!

### Day before Release Day
⚠️  Everything in this section is important. It's OK to ask for advice if you're not sure.

#### Request for temporary write access to the website repo

Create a PR against [kubernetes/org](https://github.com/kubernetes/org) repo to add current Docs Lead to the
[website-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/website-maintainers) team e.g.,
[PR to org repo](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/2364)

Assign PR to current [SIG Docs chairs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs#chairs) for approval.

⚠️  write access is required to freeze the website repo and to complete tasks during the release day

⚠️  With elevated access, make sure you are not accidentally pushing to upstream by disabling `git push` command against upstream repo.
```
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```
> Note: Temporary write access to the website repo is required for the following tasks. Notify a SIG Docs chair to review and approve the PR before proceeding to the next step.

#### Freeze Kubernetes website

24 hours before the release, freeze the [k/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) repo: ⚠️  no PRs should be allowed to merge **AT ALL** until the release PR has successfully merged. There is an exception for your release PRs, which will bypass that restriction.

- Submit an issue with `tide/merge-blocker` label. Depending upon your permissions, a [SIG Docs chair](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs#leadership) can assist you with adding the label. You may need to add the label manually by selecting the gear icon in the labels section on the left-hand side of the issue after you have opened it, rather than using a `tide` command.

- Submit a freeze announcement following our [protocols](#communicate-major-deadlines) to #sig-docs and #kubernetes-contributors

#### Create the release branch

Creating the release branch lets you snapshot the current docs in a new branch, `release-[current release]`, after merging `dev-[future release]`. For example: For the 1.21 release cycle where `main` represents `v1.20`, you would create `release-1.20`.

> **Note:** Creating a branch requires someone with write access to `k/website`, such as a [SIG Docs co-chair](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs#leadership).

- From [k/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) click on `main` branch.
- Type the name of the release branch.
- **click** Create branch `release-x.yy` from `main`

![](pics/new-branch.png)

> **Note:** During the v1.29 release process, it was discovered that someone during the v1.28 release cycle had erroneously created and abandoned a `release-1.28` branch. This left the v1.29 Docs team with a release branch that was 2,330 commits behind `main`, rendering it unusuable as a release branch. Should this issue arise again, any repo admin or org admin has the necessary permissions to delete the branch. Reach out to the [SIG Docs chairs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs#leadership) to obtain their agreement that deletion is necessary. You may also be able to simply fast-forward the branch.

#### Update Netlify

Update the Netlify configuration. You will need to work with a [SIG Docs chair](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-docs#leadership) to have them complete this task for you.

Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and navigate to the Sites tab.

- Create a Netlify site that builds from `release-[current-release]` branch. Even though the `[current-release]` is currently `main` (e.g: https://kubernetes.io), eventually `main` will be a newer k8s version and we'll use the `release-[current-release]` branch to contain all prior changes - like a snapshot. (e.g https://v1-20.docs.kubernetes.io)
  - Taking the defaults here is mostly fine
  - When in doubt, compare it to a working example
  - e.g, site name: k8s-v1-20
  - e.g, custom domain: v1-20.docs.kubernetes.io

> Note: if the `release-[current-release]` is created before the website is frozen you may need to merge in main to keep up-to-date
> If you create the `release-[current-release]` right before freezing the k/website repo, it is less likely you need to keep the `release-[current-release]` up-to-date but always verify with the following steps:
To merge `main` into `release-[current-release]` on your local fork:

```shell
# Step 0 (if you don't already have a remote called "upstream")
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
# Step 1
git fetch upstream main
# Step 2
git checkout --track upstream/release-[current release]
# Step 3
git merge upstream/main
# Step 4
git checkout -b merged-main-release-[current release]
# Step 5
git commit -m "Merge main into release-[current release] to keep in sync"
# Step 6
git push origin merged-main-release-[current release]
```

Now create a pull request to merge the new branch you've made into the `release-[current-release]` branch on [k/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website).

> Note: Make a note of the commit hash of the last commit of the `release-current-release]` branch as it will be used to tag the commit as the final commit for the snapshot.

#### Merge `main`

After the freeze, if the dev-[future-release] branch is behind `main`, create a PR to merge `main` into dev-[future-release].

[Sync](#%EF%B8%8F-periodically-merge-main-into-dev-future-release) `main` into the release-[current-release] branch the day before the release.

After review from SIG Docs, both PRs will need to be merged manually using the `Create a merge commit` method of merging.

#### Get approvals for open PRs

At this stage, [integration branch] PR and configuration PRs should be ready to be reviewed and approved by Sig Docs.
Request a review for all open PRs, especially the [integration branch], to make sure it can be merged on time during the
release day.

#### Review milestone

Review milestone for completion and outstanding PRs. For PRs that won't make the release, change their milestone and make sure everyone is clear.


## Release Day
⚠️  Everything in this section is important. It's OK to ask for advice if you're not sure.

This process takes approximately 4 hours.

Coordinate with the Release Team for the exact timing. Typically the release is 'officially' built, then you merge the docs, and then you approve the blog post to "make it official". For 1.21, we merged docs at 11:00 am PDT and the blog was merged at 11:30 am PDT - marking the release "complete".

### Publish final Release Notes

- Final version of release notes committed for release
- Close the _Known Issues_ Issue and make sure everything has been resolved
- Release Notes must be merged into master prior to the release. If this is not done the release will include the latest draft.
- Keep an eye on the #release-notes channel for any requests for any questions, edits or missed release notes.

### Merge the integration branch

Once release management team has successfully cut the release, Docs Lead will merge the [integration branch] manually using
the `Create a merge commit` method of merging.
Do not delete the dev-[future-release] when GitHub asks.

- Verify that the pull request has an `approved` and an `lgtm` label.
- Remove the hold from the on-hold integration PR when needed and merge into `main`.
- Check the [Netlify build logs](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kubernetes-io-main-staging/deploys) to make sure the
site builds successfully.
- Once the site is up, validate the docs by checking the navigation, version dropdown, [generated APIs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/),
[documentation version](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/supported-doc-versions/), and random clicks.
> Note: Make a note of the commit hash of the integration branch merge

> Note: In 1.28 the Docs Release Team had failing CLA checks while merging the integration branch, in which case they made a decision to not change history at all. Rather, they merged the integration branch even with failing CLA checks since the commit did pass CLA when it was merged to `dev-1.28`, and the docs team did not want to fix this by altering history due to the side effects of doing so.

### Publish the release blog post

After validation, merge the blog post manually using the `Create a merge commit` method of merging.

- Verify that the pull request has an `approved` and an `lgtm` label.
- Remove the hold from blog post when needed and merge into `main`.
- Check the [Netlify build logs](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kubernetes-io-main-staging/deploys) to make sure the
site builds successfully.
- Navigate to the [blog page](https://kubernetes.io/blog/) to validate that release blog post is available.
- Once confirmed, notify the release team with the link to the blog post. This will allow the Release Lead to send out
a notification of the release to the Kubernetes Dev mailing list.

### Create release with tag

- Tag the commit hash before the [integration branch] as the final commit for [current release].
- Tag the commit hash of the [integration branch] as the initial commit of the [future release]

> Note: This can be done at any time post-release.
> You should have kept track of the last commit hash of the release branch, `release-[current release]` and the commit hash of the integration branch merge. The following steps will confirm the commit hashes.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/website/
cd website
git checkout main
```
```
Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```
Confirm the commit hash before the [integration branch]:
```shell
git show <merge commit of integration branch>^1
```
The following example is from the 1.21 release:
  - It was noted that the last commit hash of the `release-1.20` branch is 6d252624b21452bcf6c22f156cccd316111204d4 from PR 2738
  - The commit hash of the integration branch merge, which is the first commit of 1.21, is 969a3db92326746a94e2eb4449fd60f25d9151b8.
```shell
git show 969a3db92326746a94e2eb4449fd60f25d9151b8^1

commit 6d252624b21452bcf6c22f156cccd316111204d4 (origin/release-1.20)
Merge: d1c650d2a 5767f39fd
Author: Kubernetes Prow Robot <k8s-ci-robot@users.noreply.github.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 7 07:53:53 2021 -0700

    Merge pull request #27387 from Arhell/label

    [ja] updated labels for cli command in the PHP Guestbook tutorial
```
Proceed with tagging the commit hashes:
```shell
git tag -a snapshot-final-v1.20 6d252624b -m "Release 1.20 final snapshot"
git tag -a snapshot-initial-v1.21 969a3db92 -m "Release 1.21 initial snapshot"
git push --tags origin main
```

After creating the tags, you can create a release based off of a tag very easily. Follow the naming conventions as done before and update: https://github.com/kubernetes/website/releases

- Navigate to the [k/website releases page](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/releases)
- Click "Draft a new release"
- Enter the snapshot initial version tag in the "tag version" box
- Enter "snapshot-initial-v1.20: Release 1.20" as release title and "Release 1.20 initial snapshot" as the description.
- Click "Publish release"

> Note: 1.20 should be replaced with the [future release]

### Unfreeze Kubernetes website

Unfreeze the k/website repo as done earlier (remove the `tide/merge-blocker` label and close issue).

Afterwards, submit an unfreeze announcement following our [protocols](#communicate-major-deadlines)

### Close the [future release] milestone

- Merge the 4 config.toml's created as part of the sunsetting docs.
  - Remove hold from the configuration PRs to allow merge automatically by Prow.
- Find the open milestone for [future release] and close it. ⚠️ Be careful not to delete it.

## Same day or Day After Release - Verification, Cleanup, and Handoff
These steps should be done after the launch. They require approximately 4 hours of work.

### Review Docs Process and Update Documentation

### Hold a docs-only retro with Sig Docs

- Can we improve process?
- Can we improve playbook?
- Can we add / **remove** stuff from playbook?


## Day after Release - Prepare the Next Docs Lead for Success

### Create the dev-future-FUTURE branch

⚠️ Create a working branch (Named `dev-[future FUTURE release]`, for example `dev-1.22`) locally, based on `main`. Push it to upstream.

```shell
# This example is for a future release version 1.22
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/website.git
git checkout -b dev-1.22
git commit --allow-empty -m "Tracking commit for v1.22 docs"
git push -u origin dev-1.22
```

### Modify prow config file

Create a [pull request](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/21727) against [k/test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra)
 to configure [prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow#) to automatically apply milestones to future release branch
 and to remove the configuration for the last release e.g. [Add branch protection and milestone applier for k/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/30389).

```diff
kubernetes/website:
-   dev-1.21: 1.21
+   dev-1.22: 1.22
```


### Create milestone

Create a milestone for NEW upcoming release. Depending on your permissions, you might need to contact a SIG Docs maintainer. Move anything missed for the current release to the new milestone.

### Update Netlify

You will need to work with a [SIG Docs Chair or Technical Lead](https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-docs#leadership) to have them complete this task for you.

Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and navigate to the Sites tab.

- Clean Up
  - Delete the oldest docs site (usually a deprecated version 5+ releases ago)
  ![Delete old site](pics/netlify-delete-old-site.png)
- Update [vnext](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kubernetes-io-vnext-staging/settings) staging
  - Point at the new future dev-[future release]
  ![Update vnext](pics/netlify-update-vnext.png)
  - Taking the defaults here is mostly fine
  - When in doubt, compare it to a working example
  - (check) build only production branch

- Save the change and verify that the change is live at [https://kubernetes-io-vnext-staging.netlify.com/](https://kubernetes-io-vnext-staging.netlify.com/).

### Update Slack

Announce that `[dev-future FUTURE release]` branch is open for new feature docs on slack #sig-docs.

### Reassign issues

- Clean Up
⚠️  Assign any issues / features / PRs (that missed the release) to the new Docs Lead

### Clean up access

- ⚠️  Create a PR against the **[kubernetes/org](https://github.com/kubernetes/org) repo** to **remove** the current Docs Lead from
the [website-maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/website-maintainers) team and to **remove** current
Docs shadows from [website-milestone maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/website-milestone-maintainers/),
e.g., [Remove 1.21 shadows from sig docs teams](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/2624)
  - The current lead must stay in the website milestone maintainers list until the `[current release]` website version is officially supported.
  - The future lead must stay in the website milestone maintainers list to prepare for the next release.
- ⚠️  Create a PR against the **[kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) repo** to **remove** the current Docs Lead from [sig-docs-en-owners](https://github.com/orgs/kubernetes/teams/sig-docs-en-owners)
